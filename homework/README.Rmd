### Grading

Homework assignments will be graded out of 5 points, which are based on a combination of accuracy and effort. Below are rough guidelines for grading.

Grade | Description
------|------------------------------
5 |	All problems completed with detailed solutions provided and 75% or more of the problems are fully correct.
4 |	All problems completed with detailed solutions and 50-75% correct; OR close to all problems completed and 75%-100% correct. One point will be deducted if superfluous information is printed or if assignment is excessively long â€“ ask me if you want clarification on "excessively long."
3	| Close to all problems completed with less than 75% correct.
2	| More than half but fewer than all problems completed and at least 75% correct
1	| More than half but fewer than all problems completed and less than 75% correct; OR less than half of problems completed
0	| No work submitted, OR half or less than half of the problems submitted and without any detail/work shown to explain the solutions.
