# Materials

## R/RStudio

We will use R/RStudio as our computational engine. Please install the current version of R and RStudio at
the beginning of the term if you plan to use a local version.

The mirage server (https://mirage.mathcs.carleton.edu) is also available for your use, *but can only be accessesed on campus of via a VPN*.

## R packages

We will use numerous R packages throughout this course. They are all installed on the mirage R Studio server.
If you are working on a local install, then please run the code chunk below to install all of the packages.
I recommend doing this at the beginning of the course to avoid last minute installation issues preventing
you from completing assignments.

```
install.packages(c("mvtnorm", "loo", "coda"), dependencies = TRUE)
```
